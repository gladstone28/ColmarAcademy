The following is the link to the codecademy session on Managing Assetsx


https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites/tracks/finishing-touches-and-publishing-a-website/modules/finishing-touches/articles/f1-u7a1-managing-assets


This is a codecademy.com project. In this project the student is given a design graphic and asked to build out the website. 
Note that after starting this project I started an alternative that I renamed as QSLN Academy which is a different repo from this one and which I am presently focused. 
I intend to return to this after completing QSLN Academy. This README.md is being done here on Github and will be continued within a Month.

I am now doing the editing at the git terminal after doing a git pull.
